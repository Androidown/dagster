# Examples

This directory contains some example projects that showcase how Dagster is used in some small projects.

Some of these are actively maintained as new features are added to Dagster, while those that are labeled with the `UNMAINTAINED` tag in their README are valid projects but may not be actively maintained.

If you'd like to see a larger scale Dagster project, check out our own analytics project: [Dagster Open Platform](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-open-platform)
