  # This is our pinned MySQL test instance, running a pinned, older version of MySQL. We also use
  # this for all of our storage tests, to ensure that we're using a reasonable set of supported SQL
  # syntax (e.g. excluding INTERSECT_ALL). We also run this instance using the flag
  # --sql-require-primary-key=ON, which requires all tables to have a primary key. This should stop
  # any new tables from being added that do not have a primary key.

  # This is the same as test-mysql-db-pinned, but we use this instance to run back-compat tests on
  # the pinned older SQL instances.  Prior to 1.2.0, we did not require primary keys on all tables,
  # so some of our back-compat tests include snapshots of DBs that would cause errors when loaded on
  # a MySQL instance with --sql-require-primary-key=ON.
